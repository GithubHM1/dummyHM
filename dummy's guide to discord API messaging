#To whoever that reads this! I promise to make this as instructive as possible and if I can do it, so can you!
Discord's built in Webhooks function as an easy way to get automated messages and data updates sent to a text channel in your server.

#So what is a webhook? ðŸ˜…
If you're asking this question. You're a better student than I am. Simply put, a webhook is a Push API. 
It is a way for an app to provide other applications with real time information. But seriously, I won't bore you 
with more text. If you're a way better student than I am, please read up the following

#So what is Discord? ðŸ¥²
Ok, if you're asking this...you're probably as old if not older than I. That don't matter...I've no idea what's 
UiPath before June of 2021 too. So yes... Discord is a VoIP, instant messaging and digital distribution platform 
designed for everyday people. Users communicate with voice calls, video calls, text messaging, media and files in private chats 
or as part of communities called "servers".  Usually for gamers and for technophiles, Discord isn't as popular as Whatsapp, Telegram or 
Facebook. So I won't really blame you if you didn't hear of them!


#So how do we get there? ðŸ¤”
In order to first get this started, you'll have to install Discord on your laptop.

Once you've launched Discord, play around with the interface! I mean seriously!!! You don't expect to be spoon
fed every step of the way do you?
